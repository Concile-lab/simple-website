		<h3>Closing the Deal</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Know how much you're willing to accept and prepare to negotiate to a minimum price.</li>
			<li>Don't take your ad down until you are certain you have received payment from the buyer - it won't cost you anything to have it up longer.</li>
			<li>Don't rely on "proof" of payment from the buyer. Check with your bank or other provider that the money has been cleared and you can see the funds in your account before parting with your item.</li>
			<li>Only accept cash inside the premises of your bank where potential fakes can be checked or so you do not carry large amounts of cash in public after a sale.</li>
			<li>Beware of forged bank cheques. Electronic transfers which can be confirmed by your bank are the safest option. A genuine buyer will never object.</li>
